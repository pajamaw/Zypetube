Assignment Guidelines
=====================

This assignment will be done in two parts:

1. High level architecture overview.
  * Explain how the site will function from a broad level. Describe the architecture of
the app and how it will communicate with the Zype api. Give an overview of the models and controllers. Describe where various portions of the functionality and logic will be. You can use diagrams if you would like.
  * Keep in mind that this application will eventually do more than simply allow a user to login, so design the app the be flexible and modular.
2. Code the basic application.
  * Send us a link to a github repository with your source code.
  * Bonus points if we can run the app via a publicly accessible url.
